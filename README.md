# Polymarket MCP App

A minimalist MCP app for exploring Polymarket prediction markets. It provides a clean, bar‑style UI with widgets for trending, recent, search, market detail (with chart), and a compact portfolio view — built to let judges understand market context at a glance and drill into specific markets quickly.

This is an MCP server project bootstrapped with [`create-mcp-use-app`](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/getting-started/quickstart).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/inspector](http://localhost:3000/inspector) with your browser to test your server.

You can start building by editing the entry file. Add tools, resources, and prompts — the server auto-reloads as you edit.
